      "response": "WONT_DO",
      "action": "The current implementation already has safeguards to minimize false positives: (1) requires 2+ different markdown pattern types to be detected, (2) only processes content with minimal/acceptable HTML structure (wrapper tags like p/div/span or inline formatting). A user writing an HTML tutorial about markdown would typically use semantic HTML elements like <article>, <section>, <code>, <pre> to properly structure their content, which would NOT pass the acceptable_tags check. The heuristic is designed for the primary use case of converting markdown content that was stored with minimal HTML wrapping. Making it more conservative would break legitimate markdown-in-HTML-wrapper scenarios which is the main problem this function solves."

      "action": "Removed the unused 'i' variable by changing 'for i, sibling in enumerate(siblings)' to 'for sibling in siblings' since only the sibling element is used in the loop."

  ],
  "summary": "Fixed both major and minor issues: (1) Removed temporary review files (revision-response.json, .code-review-output.json) from the repository, (2) Removed unused enumerate index variable in html_processor.py. The content transformation concern was assessed as acceptable given existing safeguards - the 2+ pattern requirement and acceptable HTML structure check provide sufficient protection against false positives while supporting the primary markdown-in-HTML-wrapper use case."
