  "summary": "Clean implementation that adds a description_md field to Page and PageVersion models with automatic HTML-to-Markdown conversion on save. The code follows existing patterns in the codebase and uses the already-included beautifulsoup4 dependency.",

  "positives": [
    "Follows existing pattern in codebase - mirrors the description_stripped implementation exactly",
    "BeautifulSoup is already a project dependency (beautifulsoup4==4.12.3), no new dependencies needed",
    "Comprehensive HTML-to-Markdown conversion supporting headings, lists, tables, code blocks, links, images, and custom components",
    "Read-only serializer field prevents client from directly setting description_md",
    "Migration properly depends on previous migration (0116)",
    "Clean separation with new field being automatically derived from description_html on save",
    "Handles edge cases like empty strings and None values correctly"
