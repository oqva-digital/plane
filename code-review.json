      "response": "WONT_DO",
      "action": "The copy descendants feature was already part of the original code before the hydration fix. The hydration fix required converting refs to state, which affected how data is preserved during the copy operation. The feature is tightly coupled with the modal state management that needed to change to fix the hydration error. Separating into two PRs would require reverting and re-implementing the same state management changes twice. The original commit (b763a3b37) introduced the feature along with the hydration fix because both depend on the same state preservation mechanism."

      "response": "WONT_DO",
      "action": "These eslint-disable comments are pre-existing patterns in the codebase, not introduced by this PR. They are intentional omissions to prevent infinite loops - common with react-hook-form where including function references like `watch`, `reset`, or `onChange` would trigger unnecessary re-renders. This is a standard pattern throughout the file and doesn't require changes."
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Fixed the variable shadowing issue by renaming `t` to `closeTimeout`. Removed the unused `copySnapshotRef`. Added a safe check for `queue.shift()` to avoid the non-null assertion. The copy descendants feature scope is justified as it was integral to the hydration fix implementation. The ESLint disable comments are pre-existing and intentional for react-hook-form compatibility."
