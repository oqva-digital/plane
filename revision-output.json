Introducing a constant only in this file would create inconsistency. While constants exist in the codebase (e.g., plane/db/models/project.py), the API views consistently use the literal value."

The PATCH and DELETE endpoints were already implemented; updated documentation to reflect this. IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md now documents all four endpoints: POST, GET (list and detail), PATCH, and DELETE."
