      "response": "WONT_DO",
      "action": "The current order matches the app-level pattern exactly. In apps/api/plane/app/views/page/base.py lines 400-407, the app-level destroy() method also calls page.delete() first (line 400), then deletes UserFavorite records (lines 402-407). The API endpoint is correctly following this established pattern."

      "response": "WILL_DO",
      "action": "Added authorization check at apps/api/plane/api/views/page.py:211-222 that verifies the requesting user is either the page owner (page.owned_by_id == request.user.id) or a project admin (role=20). Returns 403 Forbidden with error message 'Only admin or owner can delete the page' if neither condition is met. Also added ProjectMember to the imports."

  "summary": "Addressed the authorization issue by adding the missing owner/admin check to the delete method. Declined to change the order of operations as the current implementation correctly matches the app-level pattern where page.delete() is called before UserFavorite cleanup."
