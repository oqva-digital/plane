  "summary": "The developer has addressed the authorization check issue correctly. The WONT_DO response for the order of operations issue is justified - verified that the app-level implementation in base.py:400-407 does call page.delete() before UserFavorite cleanup, so the API endpoint correctly follows this pattern.",
