      "action": "Refactored _has_markdown_patterns() to require at least 2 different pattern types to be detected before considering content as markdown. Also added requirement for at least 2 list items before counting lists as a pattern. This prevents false positives from plain text that happens to contain a single dash or asterisk."

  "summary": "Fixed all 4 issues: (1) Refactored markdown detection to require at least 2 different pattern types, preventing false positives from single dashes/asterisks in plain text; (2) Added separator='\\n' to get_text() calls to preserve line breaks; (3) Removed dead code (unused patterns list) as part of the refactoring; (4) Deleted the development file revision_response.json."
