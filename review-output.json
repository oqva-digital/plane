  "summary": "Solid implementation for handling markdown content sent via API. The approach of detecting markdown patterns and converting hybrid content (mix of HTML tags and raw markdown) through a markdown intermediary is reasonable. Code is well-documented and follows existing patterns.",
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "minor",
      "file": "apps/api/plane/utils/html_processor.py",
      "line": 307,
      "description": "The re.MULTILINE flag is redundant when checking individual stripped lines since ^ already matches at the start of the string",
      "suggestion": "Can remove re.MULTILINE from the per-line re.search() calls, but this is cosmetic and doesn't affect functionality"
    },

      "line": 1,
      "description": "review-output.json and revision-response.json are included in the commit but appear to be temporary review/process files",
      "suggestion": "Consider removing these files from the commit or adding them to .gitignore if they're generated during the review process"
    }
  ],
  "positives": [
    "Requiring at least 2 different markdown pattern types is a good approach to avoid false positives from plain text that happens to contain dashes or asterisks",
    "The hybrid content handling (HTML → markdown → HTML) correctly preserves formatting like bold/italic that was already converted while processing raw markdown syntax",
    "Good separation of concerns with helper functions (_has_markdown_patterns, is_markdown_content, markdown_to_html, process_description_html)",
    "Clear docstrings explaining the purpose and behavior of each function",
    "The markdown detection logic correctly handles edge cases like requiring 2+ list items to count as a list pattern",
    "Using the markdown library with sensible extensions (tables, fenced_code, nl2br, sane_lists) provides good compatibility"
