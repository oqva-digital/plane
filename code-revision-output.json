    {
      "issue": "Archive permission logic inverted - rejected admin/member users instead of non-owner non-admins",
      "response": "WILL_DO",
      "action": "Fixed the bulk archive permission logic to match the single archive endpoint pattern. Changed from 'if (admin OR owner)' to 'if (admin AND NOT owner) continue', ensuring only owners and admins can archive pages. This now correctly skips pages the user doesn't have permission for."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Delete permission check uses hardcoded role=20 instead of ROLE constant",
      "response": "WILL_DO",
      "action": "Updated bulk delete permission check to use 'role__gte=ROLE.ADMIN.value' instead of hardcoded 'role=20'. This improves code maintainability and consistency with the codebase's use of permission constants."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Archive error not shown to user via toast notification",
      "response": "WILL_DO",
      "action": "Added setToast with TOAST_TYPE.ERROR and TOAST_TYPE.SUCCESS to the bulk archive handler in bulk-action-toolbar.tsx. Users now receive feedback when archive operations succeed or fail, matching the UX pattern used in the delete modal."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Unused onToggleSelection prop passed to PagesListHeaderRoot",
      "response": "WILL_DO",
      "action": "Removed the unused onToggleSelection prop from the Props type definition in header/root.tsx and removed the empty callback from pages-list-view.tsx. The component doesn't use this prop, so it was unnecessary."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Non-Pythonic empty list check using 'if not len(page_ids)'",
      "response": "WILL_DO",
      "action": "Replaced both occurrences of 'if not len(page_ids)' with 'if not page_ids' in the bulk archive and bulk delete endpoints. This follows Python best practices since empty lists are falsy."
    },
    {
      "issue": ".implementation-summary.md should not be committed",
      "response": "WILL_DO",
      "action": "Removed the .implementation-summary.md file from the repository as it's a development artifact that shouldn't be version controlled."
    }
  ],
  "summary": "All code review issues have been addressed. Fixed the critical archive permission bug that would have prevented legitimate users from archiving pages. Improved code quality by using proper role constants, adding user feedback via toasts, removing unused code, and following Python best practices. All changes maintain consistency with existing codebase patterns."
