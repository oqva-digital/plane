      "response": "WILL_DO",
      "action": "Updated html_processor.py with two fixes: (1) Modified _has_markdown_patterns() to detect headings that appear inline (without proper line breaks) by using a more flexible regex pattern and making heading detection sufficient on its own to trigger markdown conversion. (2) Modified markdown_to_html() to preprocess content by adding line breaks before heading patterns that appear inline, ensuring the markdown library can properly convert headings like '# Title ### Section' into proper HTML headings."

  ],
  "summary": "Fixed both issues: (1) Changed markdown library version to 3.10.1 as requested. (2) Improved markdown detection and conversion to handle content sent via API where markdown headings may appear inline without proper line breaks. The is_markdown_content() function now detects headings more reliably, and markdown_to_html() preprocesses content to ensure headings are properly converted to HTML."
